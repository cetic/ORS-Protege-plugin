<h1>Prot&#x00E9g&#x00E9 Code Generation Plugin</h1>
<p>
The purpose of this plugin is to ease the transition from ontology development to application development.  It generates java code allowing application developers to access and modify an ontology.  It is similar to the Prot&#x00E9g&#x00E9 3 code generation plugins except that the code generated by this plugin is used with the <a href="http://owlapi.sourceforge.net">Manchester OWL API.</a> The plugin provides access to the code generation capability through a code generation menu item under the tools menu.
</p>
I would like to give special thanks to Berkan Sesan who tried this plugin out despite several bugs and provided some very useful feedback.
