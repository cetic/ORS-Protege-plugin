# ORS-Protege-plugin

The Ontology Repository Services (ORS) is a tool for generating web services for storing and managing information of a domain and its metadata.
The ORS-Protege-plugin is a plugin for the [Protege]() ontology editor that can be used for generating the Java Model from the OWL ontology for using it with ORS.

This plugin is based on the Protege-OWL code generator plugin by Timothy Redmond.

## 3 Releases

### Release 0.1 - 18 April 2018

First public release of ORS-Protege-plugin.

This version supports:

* generates java POJOs
* generates namespaceconfig.properties file

## 4 Build & Deploy

Build the plugin:

 >mvn clean package

Deploy it by copying the jar file into Protege's plugin directory 

 >cp target/
 
## 5 Using the plugin

* From XSD: if the project has developed an XSD (some cases useful for defining the WS API), it can be used for generating the POJOS using [xjc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/xjc.html)
* From OWL: Use the [ORS-Protege-plugin](https://github.com/cetic/ORS-Protege-plugin) 
* Manually: create a POJO for each OWL class with all the prooperties as java class members and write the get/set operations. Add the @XMLRootElement annotation on each java class definition.

NOTE: Class names of POJOS must follow the java class name conventions and rules (for example cannot use reserved java names). If conventions and rules are not followed the POJOs will not be used correctly in the generated project or not at all! This is likely to affect the names used in XSD schema elements or OWL classes.
