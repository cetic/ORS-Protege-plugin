The ORS-Protege-plugin is a plugin for the [Protege](https://github.com/protegeproject/protege) ontology editor that can be used for generating the Java Model from the OWL ontology for using it with ORS.

## 5 Using the plugin


NOTE: Class names of POJOS must follow the java class name conventions and rules (for example cannot use reserved java names). If conventions and rules are not followed the POJOs will not be used correctly in the generated project or not at all! This is likely to affect the names used in XSD schema elements or OWL classes.
